# Pytho - Generators

# Generators are functions that can pause and resume their execution.
# When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object, which is an iterator.
# The code inside the function is not executed yet, it is only compiled. The function only executes when you iterate over the generator.

# Generators allow you to iterate over data without storing the entire dataset in memory.
# Instead of using return, generators use the yield keyword.


# The yield Keyword

# The yield keyword is what makes a function a generator.
# When yield is encountered, the function's state is saved, and the value is returned. The next time the generator is called, it continues from where it left off.

def count_up_to(n):
    count = 1
    
    while count <= n:
        yield count
        count += 1
# Unlike return, which terminates the function, yield pauses it and can be called multiple times.
for num in count_up_to(5):
    print(num)


# Generators Saves Memory

# Generators are memory-efficient because they generate values on-the-fly instead of storing everything in memory.
